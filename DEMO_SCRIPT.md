"Welcome to UGTours, my final year project addressing a real challenge in Uganda's tourism industry.

Uganda is known as the Pearl of Africa, blessed with incredible natural beauty and wildlife. Yet tourists face a common problem: information is scattered across multiple websites, internet connectivity is unreliable in remote areas, and currency conversion creates constant confusion.

UGTours solves these challenges. It's an offline-first mobile application that serves as your complete digital guide to Uganda - from discovering attractions to booking accommodations, all without needing an internet connection."

**Voiceover:**

"Here's one of the most practical features of UGTours: the intelligent pricing engine.

Tourists constantly struggle with currency conversion. Lodges advertise prices in US Dollars, but payments are made in Ugandan Shillings. This creates confusion and uncertainty.

Look at Buhoma Lodge here. The app displays the price as four hundred dollars, and immediately shows the Uganda Shilling equivalent - one million, four hundred sixteen thousand shillings. The conversion uses the current exchange rate of one dollar equals three thousand five hundred forty shillings.

This dual-currency display eliminates mental math and helps tourists budget accurately on the spot. Whether you think in dollars or shillings, you have complete financial clarity.

When I tap 'Book Now', I can select my dates, specify the number of guests, and the app automatically calculates the total cost in both currencies. I can even add special requests like 'window view preferred' or dietary requirements."

**Voiceover:**

"After confirming the booking, it's saved to my account. In the Bookings tab, I can see all my reservations with complete details - dates, pricing, and status.

This booking management system helps tourists keep track of their entire trip in one place.

In the Profile section, I can view and edit my account information. When I'm ready, I can securely log out.

The beauty of this system is that all my data - favorites, bookings, and preferences - is safely stored. When I log back in, everything is exactly as I left it, thanks to secure local data persistence."
