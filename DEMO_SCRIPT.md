## 0:00 - 0:40 | Introduction & Context
**Visual:** [Start with a title card "UGTours: Final Year Project". Fade to App Icon on phone screen. Launch App.]
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"Welcome to the demonstration of **UGTours**, my final year project. Tourism is one of Uganda's biggest assets, yet for many travelers, finding reliable, centralized information is a struggle. We often rely on word-of-mouth or fragmented websites.
UGTours functions as a comprehensive, offline-first digital guide. It's designed to help tourists—both local and international—discover attractions, understand costs in their local currency, and navigate their journey with confidence."

## 0:40 - 1:20 | User Onboarding (Authentication)
**Visual:** [App launches to Login Screen. Taps 'Register Account'. Fills in: Name (e.g., 'Batya Tonny'), Email, Password. Taps 'Sign Up'. Spinner shows loading. Success Toast.]
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"The journey begins with security. We don't just want anonymous users; we want a personalized experience.
Here, I am registering a new account. The system validates my credentials in real-time, ensuring data integrity. Once registered, I'm automatically logged in.
This authentication layer is crucial for features we'll see later, like saving favorites and managing user profiles."

## 1:20 - 2:00 | The Dashboard & Discovery
**Visual:** [Home Screen loads. Slow scroll down. Horizontal swipe on 'Popular Destinations'. Tap on 'Categories' chip (e.g., 'National Parks').]
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"We have arrived at the Home Dashboard. The interface is built using Material Design principles for a clean, intuitive look.
At the top, we have our 'Popular Destinations' slider, showcasing the gems of Uganda. Below, we have categorized lists.
Whether I'm interested in 'Cultural Sites' or 'Adventure', the app filters the content instantly. Notice how smooth the scrolling is—this is powered by the MVVM architecture handling data efficiently in the background."

## 2:00 - 2:40 | Smart Search & Navigation
**Visual:** [Tap Search Icon. Type 'Falls'. List filters to 'Murchison Falls', 'Sipi Falls', 'Ssezibwa Falls'. Clear text. Type 'Nile'. Select 'Jinja - Source of the Nile'.]
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"Let's say I have a specific interest. I can use the Smart Search feature.
As I type 'Falls', the list updates dynamically. It searches not just names, but descriptions too.
Let's select 'Jinja - Source of the Nile'.
This seamless navigation ensures that users verify their destination before committing to a trip."

## 2:40 - 3:25 | Deep Dive & Favorites Feature
**Visual:** [In Detail View for Jinja. Scroll text. Swipe through image gallery. Tap the 'Heart' icon (Favorite). Go back. Navigate to 'Saved'/'Favorites' tab. Show Jinja listed there.]
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"Inside the Attraction View, we get the full story. Historical context, key activities, and high-resolution imagery.
Now, imagine I'm planning a trip for next month. I can tap this 'Heart' icon to save it to my Favorites.
If I navigate to my 'Saved' tab, there it is. This local persistence allows me to build a personalized itinerary that I can access even when I'm deep in the village without internet access."

## 3:25 - 4:05 | Accommodation & The Pricing Engine
**Visual:** [Go back to an Attraction (e.g., Bwindi). Scroll to 'Nearby Accommodations'. Pause on a price tag.]
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"Here is arguably the most practical feature of UGTours: The Pricing Engine.
Tourists often struggle with currency conversion. Lodges quote in Dollars; locals pay in Shillings.
Look at 'Buhoma Lodge'. The app reads the USD price range—say, $400—and *automatically* calculates the Uganda Shilling equivalent (approx. 1.4 million UGX) using a real-time logical conversion.
This dual-display eliminates confusion and helps users budget accurately on the spot."

## 4:05 - 4:40 | Profile & Settings
**Visual:** [Navigate to Profile Tab. Show User Details. Click 'Edit Profile'. Change Name. Save. Go to Settings. Toggle a switch (e.g., Notifications). Logout.]
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"Finally, the app puts the user in control. In the Profile section, I can manage my personal details.
I can also visit Settings to customize my experience or log out securely.
The app remembers my preferences using Android DataStore, ensuring that when I return, the app feels exactly how I left it."

## 4:40 - 5:00 | Conclusion
**Visual:** [Return to Login Screen. Fade to Black with "Thank You" text.]
**Audio (Voiceover):**
"UGTours is more than just a list of places; it's a complete travel tool. By combining robust architecture with user-centric features like offline access and currency conversion, it solves real problems for Ugandan tourism.
My name is Batya Tonny Boyo. Thank you for watching."
